## Shattering Expectations
> Plurality encompasses a range of experiences poorly defined by any one conception.<br/>
> Whether you're talking to a system, or considering what's inside yourself, here's what not to take for granted.

### Numbers
A body and an individual is not neccesarily a 1:1 relationship. Conversely, not everyone under the plural umbrella can be modelled as "multiple people in a body".
Plurality is a queerness of cardinality, encompassing all the fuzzy lines where we can't confidently state that 1:1 relationship in all senses and cases.
These *system configurations* are diverse, and represent a variety of lived experiences - whether it's a system of ~7, 31, 2, 1,000,000, or 1*.

### Names
As pluralfolk, we always lay *between* the extremes of our bodies containing one person, and our being a multiple-bodied group of people. 
System members might have a name each, a name for the whole system, both at the same time, many names each - maybe share *a* name with another headmate with whom their lines blur. A name could be a composite - representing the parts working in tandem to speak or act, or have layers of complexity below the surface.
A newly self-discovered system might keep their old name to refer to the system, to refer to a specific headmate, or to refer to any arbitrary headmate in a kind of "hey, you!" fashion - it's all up to the individual(s). 

### Gender
Like genderqueers neccesitate understanding gender as distinct from sex, pluralfolk necessitate understanding gender as distinct from the body. While both have their exceptions, different parts of a system can vary in that "gut feeling" of gender, and so might (say) use unique pronouns, and hold a different conception of their transness. 

### Sexuality
A notable variance in _system configuration_ is in what bleeds over (or stays constant) between headmates.
The answer always lies between the extremes, but where exactly varies - memory might be totally contiguous, or almost completely individualised. Headmates may share beliefs, but differ in opinions - share interests, but differ in tastes.
Sexuality falls under this concept - a varying taste in other people throughout the system, minorly or majorly. 
With this in mind, pluralfolk that consider their overall sexuality non-monogamous, or somwhere on the aromantic or asexual spectrum, can be quite common. 

### Appearance
In most of our society, how you appear is a key part of your identity and individuality. Pluralfolk can rarely make exclusive claim to the appearance of the body, so self-perception often differs between headmates - whether different styles or proportions on the body, or a totally different body entirely, a shared understanding of how someone appears on this _meta-physical_ level is often key to social connection. 

### Humanity

### Causality
Nobody knows for sure why they're conscious, and this is no different for systems. 
As covered in _More Than One_, many systems hold belief in why exactly they are plural - reasons accidental, deliberate, spiritual, unknowable, and so on. 
Sometimes the absence of this _causal belief_ reflects a system's philosophy too - "don't know, can't know, it's not important".
