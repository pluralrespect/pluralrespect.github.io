## Shattering Expectations
> Plurality encompasses a range of experiences poorly defined by any one conception.<br/>
> Whether you're talking to a system, or considering what's inside yourself, here's what not to take for granted.

### Numbers
A body and an individual is not neccesarily a 1:1 relationship. Conversely, not everyone under the plural umbrella can be modelled as "multiple people in a body".
Plurality is a queerness of cardinality, encompassing all the fuzzy lines where we can't confidently state that 1:1 relationship in all senses and cases.
These *system configurations* are diverse, and represent a variety of lived experiences - whether it's a system of 7, 31, 2, 1,000,000, or 1*.

### Names

### Gender

### Sexuality

### Appearance

### Humanity

### Causality
As covered in _More Than One_, systems often hold belief (or disinterest) in why exactly they're plural - in the same way any singlet might ponder why they're alive.<br/>
Nobody knows for sure why they're conscious, and this is no different for systems.
