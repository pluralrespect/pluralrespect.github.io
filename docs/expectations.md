## Shattering Expectations
> Plurality encompasses a range of experiences poorly defined by any one conception.<br/>
> Whether you're talking to a system, or considering what's inside yourself, here's what not to take for granted.

### Numbers
A body and an individual is not neccesarily a 1:1 relationship. Conversely, not everyone under the plural umbrella can be modelled as "multiple people in a body".
Plurality is a queerness of cardinality, encompassing all the fuzzy lines where we can't confidently state that 1:1 relationship in all senses and cases.
These *system configurations* are diverse, and represent a variety of lived experiences - whether it's a system of ~7, 31, 2, 1,000,000, or 1*.

### Names
As pluralfolk, we always lay *between* the extremes of our bodies containing one person, and our being a multiple-bodied group of people. 
System members might have a name each, a name for the whole system, both at the same time, many names each - maybe share *a* name with another headmate with whom their lines blur. A name could be a composite - representing the parts working in tandem to speak or act, or have layers of complexity below the surface.
A newly self-discovered system might keep their old name to refer to the system, to refer to a specific headmate, or to refer to any arbitrary headmate in a kind of "hey, you!" fashion - it's all up to the individual(s). 

### Gender
Like genderqueers neccesitate understanding gender as distinct from sex, pluralfolk necessitate understanding gender as distinct from the body. While both have their exceptions, different parts of a system can vary in that "gut feeling" of gender, and so might (say) use unique pronouns, and hold a different conception of their transness. 

### Sexuality

### Appearance

### Humanity

### Causality
As covered in _More Than One_, systems often hold belief (or disinterest) in why exactly they're plural - in the same way any singlet might ponder why they're alive.<br/>
Nobody knows for sure why they're conscious, and this is no different for systems.
