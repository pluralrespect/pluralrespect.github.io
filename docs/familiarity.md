## Gaining Familiarity

> Becoming familiar with plurality is a strange, intuitive, and counterintuitive process that rewires the brain.<br/>
> Here's a breakdown of what those oft-alluded _plural experiences_ tend to be, and what to expect on the observing end, too.

### Switching

At this point we need to narrow our focus somewhat - switching fronts is not a universal plural experience, but it has unique impacts both internally and externally that warrant discussion.
At first, switches look (to an onlooker) and feel (to the system) rather strange and unnatural.
The sensations are unfamiliar, be it feeling like "waking up", like you've put on new prescription glasses, or like there's something intangible sliding into place in your head.
These unfamiliar sensations can create unfamiliar looking reactions - daydreamy eye-glazing, sudden adjustments in posture, wincing, and so on. 

Of course, it's not all accidental, as many steps can be taken to help "settle" a new front - standing up and stretching, yawning or scrunching up the face, clearing the throat, and all manner of extras that might work better for specific systems, or specific system members. 
The reason these adjustments can work is that different system members often unconsciously prefer to utilize the body in different ways: posture, gait, voice tone, pitch, and timbre, facial expressions, and their "resting" face.
As a singlet, one tends to assume that a lot of these things are baked into the body physically - so it can be surprising or even disconcerting to initially observe this varying in a single body.

Over time, you become accustomed to the differences between fronts - both the less conscious as mentioned, and more conscious like median mood, interests, fashion and music taste, and so on - and this tends to cause some rewiring.
As a system, this might help you settle into fronts, better recognize and allow certain habits or urges associated with a front, or develop the skill to prompt a switch deliberately, which some systems have.
As an observer, you'll find the way you recognize people subtly diversifies. Details that were previously invisible on a face or body become quite obvious, and you may find you can recognize an individual system member by sight - or at least narrow it down substantially. Of course, this is never completely reliable, nor is it particularly polite to "guess" at a system's front unprompted - and as always, all systems vary.

On a more practical level, when an observer is familiar to the system ("behind the curtain" as _more than one_ puts it), it may be practical to signal a front. 
The obvious "hi, it's [name]" is functional, but quite often feels awkward, unnatural, or even objectifying. 
Instead, a system might opt to swap out a name tag or other accessory, change a decorator on their chat messages (such as an emoji or signature), or make a game of it and prompt someone to guess at their front.

So far, "front" and "system member" have been used relatively interchangably, but it's worth understanding that in a system that does switch, fronts may provide a more intuitive model of their composition, rather than a permanent roster of members.
A front may not be purely the presence of a permanent resident, but rather a combination of aspects of the overall system. 
This model is by no means universal - rather one example of the many ways a plural system might conceptualize themselves - but is a decent basis to understand how a system might end up with a front "between" two fronts (rather than a _cofront_, where it feels like two members are present), a front expressed as "no front", often a big blurry feeling smearing over all known fronts, or a front that feels like a "variant" of a regular fronter, with slight but distinct differences.

### Discovery

New fronts and newly discovered systemhood present their own unique and at times challenging experiences. 

- Sensations associated with new fronts and repressed systemhood, experiences of early fronting
- Connecting the old with the new, consensually

### Relationships

- Diversity in intrasystem communication - headspace, notes, chat
- Intrasystem relationships - backchatter, cofronting, opinions, mediation
- Behind-curtain relations with system members - rapport smearing, engaging with metaphysicality
