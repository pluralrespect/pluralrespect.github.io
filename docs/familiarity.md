## Gaining Familiarity

> Becoming familiar with plurality is a strange, intuitive, and counterintuitive process that rewires the brain.<br/>
> Here's what some of those oft-alluded _plural experiences_ tend to be, to a system or to an observer.

### Switching

At this point we need to narrow our focus somewhat - switching fronts is not a universal plural experience, but it has unique impacts both internally and externally that warrant discussion.
At first, switches look (to an onlooker) and feel (to the system) rather strange and unnatural.
The sensations are unfamiliar, be it like "waking up", like you've put on new prescription glasses, or like there's something intangible sliding into place in your head.
These unfamiliar sensations can create unfamiliar looking reactions - daydreamy eye-glazing, sudden adjustments in posture, wincing, and so on.

Of course, it's not all accidental, as many steps can be taken to help "settle" a new front - standing up and stretching, yawning or scrunching up the face, clearing the throat, and all manner of extras that might work better for specific systems, or specific system members.
The reason these adjustments work is that different system members often unconsciously prefer to utilize the body in different ways: posture, gait, vocal tone/pitch/timbre, facial expressions, and their "resting" face.
As a singlet, one tends to assume that these things are physically part of the body - so it can be surprising or even disconcerting to observe these varying initially.

Over time, you become accustomed to the differences between fronts, and this tends to cause some rewiring.
As a system, this might help you settle into fronts, better recognize and allow certain habits, tastes, or urges associated with a front, or develop the skill to prompt a switch deliberately, which some systems have.
As an observer, you'll find the way you recognize people subtly diversifies beyond more obvious clues like clothes or speech patterns.
Faces and bodies that were "the same" before become distinct, and you might start to recognize (or at least narrow down) fronts by sight.
Of course, this is never completely reliable, nor is it particularly polite to "guess" at a system's front unprompted - and as always, all systems vary.

On a more practical level, when an observer is familiar to the system ("behind the curtain" as _more than one_ puts it), it may be practical to signal a front.
The obvious "hi, it's [name]" is functional, but quite often feels awkward, unnatural, or even objectifying.
Instead, a system might opt to swap out a name tag or other accessory, change a decorator on their chat messages (such as an emoji or signature), or make a game of it and prompt someone to guess at their front.

So far, "front" and "system member" have been used relatively interchangeably, but it's worth understanding that in a system that does switch, fronts may provide a more intuitive model of their composition, rather than a permanent roster of members.
A front may not be purely the presence of a permanent resident, but rather a combination of aspects of the overall system.
This model is by no means universal - rather one example of the many ways a plural system might conceptualize themselves - but is a decent basis to understand how a system might end up with a front "between" two fronts (rather than a _cofront_, where it feels like two members are present), a front expressed as "no front" (often a big blurry feeling, between all fronts), or a front that feels like a "variant" of a regular front, with slight but distinct differences.

### Discovery

New fronts and newly discovered systemhood present their own unique and at times challenging experiences.

- Sensations associated with new fronts and repressed systemhood, experiences of early fronting
- Connecting the old with the new, reassociating and re-meeting new headmates

### Relationships

Becoming familiar with a system is a process, and this is especially true when it's your own.
Some systems can hold conversations in their own heads, others leave notes for eachother, others still talk in private chat rooms, and some can't do any of those things at all.
Without a direct line of communication, one would assume that there's no way to foster positive intra-system relationships between system members.
This is true under a singlet-normative understanding of interpersonal relationships, but we can do a bit better.
By observing others interacting with the world and mutual friends outside the system, a system's members can slowly develop opinions of eachother.
Without a way to directly communicate, these opinions form the bases of non-speaking intrasystem relationships.
Without a word to one another, system members can still do things they know their other headmates struggle with, speak to friends about how they feel about eachother, make little comments right after getting into the front, and in many cases, bubble up their feelings and thoughts without being in the front - like your ears burning when someone says your name.
It's often quite unlike a relationship between two bodies, but as you've likely realised, it simply does not need to be.
