## Gaining Familiarity

> Becoming familiar with plurality is a strange, intuitive, and counterintuitive process that rewires the brain.<br/>
> Here's what some of those oft-alluded _plural experiences_ tend to be, to a system or to an observer.

### Switching

At this point we need to narrow our focus somewhat - switching fronts is not a universal plural experience, but it has unique impacts both internally and externally that warrant discussion.
In this chapter, we'll primarily address switching systems, with some paragraphs that can be applied more generally.

At first, switches can be strange and unnatural.
The sensations are unfamiliar, be it like "waking up", a new pair of glasses, or like something intangible is sliding into place in your head.
This can make it look strange, too - daydreamy eye-glazing, sudden adjustments in posture, wincing, and so on. 
It's not all accidental - stretching, yawning, scrunching your nose, and clearing your throat, can all help deliberately settle in a new front.
This works because different headmates tend to utilize the body differently: posture, gait, voice, facial expressions, or even just their "resting" face.

Over time, you become accustomed to the differences between fronts.
As a system, this helps fronts settle better, be more accepting of your own differences, or help you be able to switch fronts deliberately - which some systems can do.
As an observer, recognizing fronts gets easier, beyond obvious clues like clothing or speech patterns.
This is never completely reliable (and it's rude to guess a front unprompted!), but it can help you understand a system a bit more. 
Realistically, it's more practical for a system to deliberately signal a change of front.
The obvious "hi, it's [name]" is functional, but can feel a bit objectifying.
Instead, you could swap a name tag or accessory, change up decorations in chat messages (e.g. an emoji or signature), or ask someone to guess your front.

In systems that switch, the word "front" can also provide a more intuitive model for system composition, rather than a permanent roster of "system members".
In just one example of a way a system might conceptualize themselves - a front may not be purely the presence of a permanent resident, but rather a combination of aspects of the overall system.
Through a changing self-conceptualization, systems are able to adjust to understand new experiences. 
Co-fronts, fronts "between" other fronts, a "nothing" or "blurry" feeling front, or a "variant" on a usual front are all experiences that can challenge our model of systemhood. Don't be afraid to adapt if something new feels right.

### Discovery

New fronts and newly discovered systemhood present their own unique and at times challenging experiences.

- Sensations associated with new fronts and repressed systemhood, experiences of early fronting
- Connecting the old with the new, reassociating and re-meeting new headmates

### Relationships

Becoming familiar with a system is a process, and this is especially true when it's your own.
Some systems can hold conversations in their own heads, others leave notes for eachother, others still talk in private chat rooms, and some can't do any of those things at all.
Without a direct line of communication, one would assume that there's no way to foster positive intra-system relationships between system members.
This is true under a singlet-normative understanding of interpersonal relationships, but we can do a bit better.
By observing others interacting with the world and mutual friends outside the system, a system's members can slowly develop opinions of eachother.
Without a way to directly communicate, these opinions form the bases of non-speaking intrasystem relationships.
Without a word to one another, system members can still do things they know their other headmates struggle with, speak to friends about how they feel about eachother, make little comments right after getting into the front, and in many cases, bubble up their feelings and thoughts without being in the front - like your ears burning when someone says your name.
It's often quite unlike a relationship between two bodies, but as you've likely realised, it simply does not need to be.

Past that initial invitation behind the curtain, being plural continues to colour our external relationships.
Developing bonds always sit somewhere between the individual headmate you spent time with, and the system as a whole.
Over time, friends can come to understand the workings of a system, and recognize some or all of its inhabitants fondly.
Through this process, friends outside the system may be able to provide better support - helping shift unhappy fronts, perceiving subtle differences, and even helping mediate conflict or feelings between members of a system.
The tolerance to the strangeness of plural existence of a friend can provide a system with a rare moment to relax and let their guard down - front less popular headmates, let the body language of a front get weirder than usual, or speak honestly to their own experiences and feelings.
As systems, to be known is often a source of terror - but it can also a source of peace.
