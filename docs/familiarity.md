## Gaining Familiarity

**Unfinished! Go read _systemhood_ and _systemhood expanded_ from v1. they're long and boring i know**

> Becoming familiar with plurality is a strange, intuitive, and counterintuitive process that rewires the brain.<br/>
> Here's a breakdown of what those oft-alluded _plural experiences_ tend to be, and what to expect on the observing end, too.

### Switching

- Sensations associated with fronting and switching - experiences of different fronts, desires, habits, etc.
- Ways of conveying a switch to others, ways of interpreting a switch in others, ways of interpreting a front in others.
- Variety in fronts - mixing vs cofronting, big blurs / null fronts, variations of known fronts.

### Discovery

- Sensations associated with new fronts and repressed systemhood, experiences of early fronting
- Connecting the old with the new, consensually

### Relationships

- Diversity in intrasystem communication - headspace, notes, chat
- Intrasystem relationships - backchatter, cofronting, opinions, mediation.
- Deeper understandings of and interactions with system members / the system as a whole
