# Plural Respect

> Welcome to Plural Respect! <br/>
> This is a crash course in plurality for systems and singlets alike.<br/>
> It builds off the groundwork and terminology of [morethanone.info](https://morethanone.info/) - read that first.

### Purpose and Demographic (Foreword) 
**Plural Respect** is intended to raise the level of plural nuance and intuition that can be gained from primer-style website. Where _more than one_ conveys an explanation sufficient to talk to pluralfolk or understand that you yourself are plural, *plural respect* aims to supply the neccesary understanding to be _friends_ with pluralfolk - or to become friendly with your own systemhood. To achieve this, we work to dispel assumptions about systems and systemhood, discuss the ins and outs of living as (or, in) a system, and address the challenges to comfortable existence pluralfolk face. 

This resource is for everyone - systems and singlets, know-alls and know-nothings - read it, share it, surpass and disagree with it, adapt it, revise it - if you're working towards understanding and acceptance, it's all yours.

### Formatting

This resource can be freely skimmed, but is intended to be read linearly. _Novel terminilogy_ is introduced with italics, and is built up as it progresses.

[â‡± Links: Like This]() direct to tangent micro-essays written from firsthand experience, as part of our companion resource _Plural Self-Respect_.<br/>
These are primarily oriented towards systems, and anyone looking to dive deeper into gritty details and personal experiences<br/>
If you'd prefer to read these linearly after _Plural Respect_, their directory is available in the appendix, along with extras and drafts. 

### Version 2.0

This is a 2024 rewrite of the original 2022 *plural respect* - made with a better understanding of ourselves, more conviction, more exposure to plural experiences, a more consistent tone throughout, and of course - the help of our friends. PR1.0 is available [here](/v1) for archival purposes.
