# Plural Respect

> Welcome to Plural Respect! <br/>
> This is a crash course in plurality for systems and singlets alike.<br/>
> It builds off the groundwork and terminology of [morethanone.info](https://morethanone.info/) - read that first.

### Purpose and Demographic (Foreword) 
**Plural Respect** is a primer-style resource intended to impart additional nuance and intuition to an existing understanding of plurality. 

While _More Than One_ is sufficient for talking to systems or realizing you're plural, _Plural Respect_ tries to provide an understanding fit to _befriend_ the system you know - or the one inside you. 

What this *isn't* is academia - every thought in these pages was acquired through observational understanding and lived experience, not by reviewing existing literature. Quote us as people, not as a paper in the field.  

This resource is for everyone - systems and singlets, know-alls and know-nothings - read it, share it, surpass and disagree with it, adapt it, revise it - if you're working towards understanding and acceptance, it's all yours.

### Version 2.0

This is a 2024 rewrite of the original 2022 *plural respect* - made with less redundancy, more consistency, more conviction, a better understanding of ourselves, and of course - the help of our friends. 

PR1.0 is longer, meandering, and at times incorrect - but is available [here](/v1) in case it's more complete.
