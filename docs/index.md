# Plural Respect

> Welcome to Plural Respect! <br/>
> This is a crash course in plurality for systems and singlets alike.<br/>
> It builds off the groundwork and terminology of [morethanone.info](https://morethanone.info/) - read that first.

### Foreword

**Plural Respect** is a primer-style resource intended to impart additional nuance to an existing understanding of plurality.

While _More Than One_ is sufficient for talking to systems or realizing you're plural, _Plural Respect_ attempts to instill an intuition for plural experience sufficient to befriend the system you know - or the one inside.

What this *isn't* is academia - every thought in these pages was acquired through observational understanding and lived experience, not by reviewing existing literature.
This is a firsthand account, so reference it that way if used.

This resource is for everyone - systems and singlets, know-alls and know-nothings - read it, share it, surpass and disagree with it, adapt it, revise it - if you're working towards understanding and acceptance, it's all yours.
