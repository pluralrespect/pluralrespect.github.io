# Member Identity Expanded

## Myth and Fiction

#### Appearance and Nonhuman Shortcuts

Existing myths and fictional characters are often used as quick descriptive shortcuts for members to explain their own appearance - especially for nonhuman system members. Simplified sentences are often thrown around that don’t make this explicit, such as “I’m some kind of centaur”, and while this can be okay casually it’s important to remember that these are usually shortcuts, and being explicit can proactively avoid some conflict over appropriation of myth (or intellectual property).


#### Fuzztives and OCs

Some system members relate heavily to not just a mythical or fictional creature or species but rather a specific existing character. These members are often (inappropriately archetypally, often harmfully) referred to as “fictives” or “fuzztives”, with the latter offering more acknowledgement of the member as an individual that _sees_ themself in a fictional character, and in fact is capable of making their own self discoveries and expressions as a unique person, rather than (causal-prescriptively) often considering a system member to be a 1:1 “rip-off” of an existing character that was “fabricated” in response to them. 

More generally speaking, fuzztive-esque system members might have a similar appearance to a character, a similar or adopted name, and similar attitudes or speaking patterns - however, it’s important to remember that this phenomena is also common in singlets, where both particularly relatable characters might have similar attitudes, speech patterns, or clothing styles - and even may have their names or style adopted by someone (especially trans folk) who realise that they’re able to express in those ways and be seen positively. Fuzztive-esque system members might diverge from fiction over time, sometimes even in just days, when they are given the opportunity for self exploration.

Another common intersection of fiction and plurality is Original Characters (OCs) - various creative types (writers, artists, tabletop roleplayers) might create original characters for their stories, art, or roleplaying (including sometimes video game RPG characters), that they later unearth some kind of fuzztive-esque system member relating to. Sometimes this occurs the same way that existing characters often do, where a character is reflected on and found to be relatable and expressive - however it can also be found that a system member, while repressed, either directly created or assisted in the creation of the character to express themselves.

System members that are fuzztive-esque should ensure they acknowledge the potential for harm caused by claiming certain existing properties for themselves, but should be respected like all other pluralfolk.

#### Faith and Xenomemory

To go along with system members with faith-based casualties that feel they were sent to or appeared in a system from another place, and fuzztive-esque system members who relate with a character on an identity level, some system members have what are usually called “Xenomemories” - feelings that they partially remember things that occurred to them before appearing within the system. Often this simply occurs when the given system member dreams - whether it’s the events of a past life or similar, or the events previously absorbed in fiction. These members have to take responsibility and understanding of these past xenomemories (regardless of acceptance or rejection) to be able to properly manage how they might affect how they feel in their present.


## Animals and Ages

#### Inclusion

Some system members may act in similar ways to, think in similar ways to, or be some way in effect, either of a young age or be a sentient (but not sapient) animal. It’s important to have an understanding of the way these members interact in a system, especially in regards to inclusion in spaces. One example is 18+ spaces, where often rules will need to take a minimum between the age of a system and the age of a specific member, and systems may have to disclose whether they’re able to control member interaction closely enough to safely interact in such a space. 

The aforementioned animal-esque types - not to be confused with nonhuman members capable of clear thought - are occasionally (harmfully?) referred to as “feral”, and shouldn’t be included in nsfw spaces due to an inability to consent (tldr [[2]](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harkness-test)). Many spaces (including plural spaces) aren’t really designed with animal-like system members in mind, but should make some attempt to allow for them to interact with others, while respecting that room consent could apply.


## Culture

#### Cultural/Religious Engagement / Inclusion

Some system members may feel an affinity with or simply interested in engaging in a particular culture. It’s the responsibility of both the member to _genuinely_ make attempts to engage with said culture rather than potentially raising issues with appropriation (as well as to respect the wishes of said culture with regard to whether they may engage with it at all), and for the other members of said culture to make the same reasonable allowances for a member of a system as they might towards any (“outsider”) singlet - other members of a system not engaging with a culture should not be an excuse for exclusion of another (except where this is rigidly unworkable within practice/belief).
