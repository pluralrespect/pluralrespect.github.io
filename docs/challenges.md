## External Challenges

### Sysphobia

### Sysmedicalism
Sysphobia is also applied selectively to systems by some on the basis of medical diagnosis - excluding them from communities, support, and insisting they do not fit under the plural umbrella.
Recommendations for diagnosis of and the impacts of DID are changing slowly, and practice even slower - diagnosis criteria excludes many system configurations and systems not in distress, forced merging is still widespread, and a DID diagnosis is still a common blocker for voluntary medical procedures and asylum discharges.
As a result, sysmedicalism pushes out and shames a large portion of systems by insisting that plurality is objectively observable, and that only a select few are capable of doing the observing.
In practice, this resembles transmedicalism, where trans people are excluded for lacking a gender dysphoria diagnosis, or not undergoing medical interventions.

Sysmedicalist views predominant in online spaces focus on causality - by insisting that a system's cause for existence can be objectively observed, and that there are "unacceptable" or "fake" causes, sysmeds bully other systems out of plural spaces. 
Language is key here, even among the inclusive - when [more than one's *causes*](https://morethanone.info/#causes) use the phrases "trauma plurals" and "plurals who were not originally plural", they accidentally imply it _is_ possible to know why a person exists, making it possible to exclude them on that basis. 
Similarly, many adopt the sysmedicalist categorizations of "traumagenic" (exists due to trauma) and "endogenic" (does not) without recognizing that treating these classifications as valid does the same damage, and pressure other systems to use them and expose themselves to harassment - all without using the words in an exclusionary (usually, "endos dni") fashion. 

### Syscourse
On a finer level, all kinds of systems are ostracized for having specific experiences - with a majority of systems and purported allies having a "weird" or "problematic" line above which a system being visible in public becomes unacceptable.
Most of this discourse boils down to applying a generic singlet-like understanding of plural internal experiences and the language used to describe them. 
Taken this way, all of our previous nuanced examples can easily be made objectionable. The Minotaur is cultural appropriation, intrasystem relationships are cheating, familial terms are disrespectful to "real family", _Fictives_ are copyright infringement and stealing, and the cultural and moral expectations of family members, children, and animals in the outside world can be placed strictly on headmates that resemble them - inviting exclusion based on singlet definitions of irresponsible caretaking, immaturity, and inhumanness - along with the occasional accusation of incest, rape, and bestiality.
In many ways this resembles _proship discourse_, wherein the same accusations are placed on fanfiction. Naturally, if someone can't accept the reinterpretation of usually-wrong actions and relationships in fiction, they're quite unlikely to accept those reinterpretations within the nuanced individually-defined language of plural experience.
