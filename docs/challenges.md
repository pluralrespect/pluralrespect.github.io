## Facing Challenges

> Systems are challenged in their self-acceptance, day in and day out, from without and from within.<br/>
> Here's to look out for in the wild, and what that one internal conflict might just boil down to.

### Sysphobia

Sysphobia, and internalised sysphobia, has its roots in fundamental misunderstandings of plurality and the experiences of plural systems.
More than one's *myths* covers the basics, so here's some deeper examples.

Wider society is entrenched in _singlet-normativity_ - the treating of singlethood as an assumed default and creating a view of plurality as "too complicated". This invites dismissing systems as "delusional" or "attention-seeking", as well as invoking fears in questioning plurals about the social impact of accepting oneself as a system.
Singlet-normativity also enables onlookers to treat plural experiences as exceptional, or alien - justifying dismissing system members requests or needs (seeing them as subhuman), or that systems can uniquely have the reasons they exist be observed and concluded on.
Failing to understand the diversity of plural experience can easily lead to some systems feeling objectified (treated as "fun costumes" instead of people) while others might feel they can't express themselves as a system (treated too much like entirely separate individuals) - and of course, misunderstanding the umbrella can lead to missing your own plurality, too.
These combined are often used to justify invasions of privacy - while some systems _choose_ to be open about their experiences, others are pressured by singlets that assume a system being "complicated" entitles them to know exactly how.

The most persistent struggle through plurality is likely _impostor syndrome_.
With the diversity of plural experience, there's no limit of ways to conceptualize oneself as an undeserving outsider - whether your experiences are too distressing, not distressing enough, too weird, too positive - each time your experiences change or develop, you might be challenged with self-doubt.
Against this pressure is the knowledge that all systems are different - and that you're unlikely to be experiencing plurality _wrong_ - and that you are the master of your own experiences; most of the time, if an experience feels right, then you can trust that feeling and accept it.

Naturally this struggle is not all internal; as many - often through their own insecurity - will instead choose to elect external impostors.

### Sysmedicalism

_Sysmedicalists_ are those that ostracize systems over a supposedly objective quality - often in the form of medical diagnoses. They exclude systems from communities and support, and insist they do not fit under the plural umbrella.
Recommendations for diagnosis of and the impacts of DID are changing slowly, and practice even slower - diagnosis criteria excludes many system configurations and systems not in distress, improper and abusive treatment for DID is still widespread, and a DID diagnosis is still a common blocker for voluntary medical procedures and asylum discharges.
As a result, sysmedicalism pushes out and shames a large portion of systems by insisting that plurality is objectively observable, and that only a select few are capable of doing the observing.
In practice, this resembles transmedicalism, where trans people are excluded for lacking a gender dysphoria diagnosis, or not undergoing medical interventions.

Predominant online sysmedicalist views focus on causality. By insisting that a system's cause for existence can be objectively observed, and that there are "unacceptable" or "fake" causes, systems suspected of these qualities can be excluded from plural spaces.
Language is key here, even among the inclusive - when [more than one's _causes_](https://morethanone.info/#causes) use the phrases "trauma plurals" and "plurals who were not originally plural", they accidentally imply it _is_ possible to know why a person exists, and therefore that it's possible to exclude them on that basis.
Similarly, sysmeds propagate categorizing plural systems as "traumagenic" (exists due to trauma) and "endogenic" (does not) - language which validates the idea that these are facts, not beliefs. Despite being flimsy on inspection, the usage of this language thus enables the objective "us vs. them" narrative that these sysmeds require to operate, even if those using them are not attempting to be exclusionary (in the usual "endos dni"-type fashion) at all.

### Syscourse

On a finer level, all kinds of systems are ostracized for having specific experiences - with a majority of systems and purported allies having a "weird" or "problematic" line above which a system being visible in public becomes unacceptable.
Most of this discourse boils down to applying a generic singlet-like understanding of plural internal experiences and the language used to describe them.
Taken this way, all of our previous nuanced examples can easily be made objectionable. The Minotaur is cultural appropriation, intrasystem relationships are cheating, familial terms are disrespectful to "real family", _Fictives_ are copyright infringement and stealing, and the cultural and moral expectations of family members, children, and animals in the outside world can be placed strictly on headmates that resemble them - inviting exclusion based on singlet definitions of irresponsible caretaking, immaturity, and inhumanness - along with the occasional accusation of incest, rape, and bestiality.
In many ways this resembles _proship discourse_, wherein the same accusations are placed on fanfiction. Naturally, if someone can't accept the reinterpretation of usually-wrong actions and relationships in fiction, they're quite unlikely to accept those reinterpretations within the nuanced individually-defined language of plural experience.
