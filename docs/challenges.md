### Sysphobia

### Sysmedicalism
Sysphobia is also applied selectively to systems by some on the basis of medical diagnosis - excluding them from communities, support, and insisting they do not fit under the plural umbrella.
Recommendations for diagnosis of and the impacts of DID are changing slowly, and practice even slower - diagnosis criteria excludes many system configurations and systems not in distress, forced integration is still widespread, and a DID diagnosis is still a common blocker for voluntary medical procedures and asylum discharges.
As a result, sysmedicalism pushes out and shames a large portion of systems by insisting that plurality is objectively observable, and that only a select few are capable of doing the observing.
In practice, this resembles transmedicalism, where trans people are excluded for lacking a gender dysphoria diagnosis, or undergoing medical intervention.

Another sysmedicalist avenue for exclusion is through causality.
By redefining the reason pluralfolk exist as uniquely objective compared to singlets, systems can be excluded for spaces for having an (observed as objective and perceptible) "unacceptable" causality.
More than one's _[causes](https://morethanone.info/#causes)_ demonstrates the fundamentals for this - by using phrases like "trauma plurals" and "plurals who were not originally plural", MTO implicitly asserts that it _is_ possible to know why a person exists, and thus possible to exclude them on that basis.
