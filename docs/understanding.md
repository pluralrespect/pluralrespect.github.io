## Building Understanding
> The questions "how can I learn to understand a system" and "how can a system learn to understand themselves" shares a lot of ground - so let's answer both. 

### Acceptance and Reclamation
- (Cooperation & Conflict, Repression & Reclamation, Rapport & Re-Meet)
- Accepting someone (the friend, the self) as plural as the necessary starting point
- Introduce "re-meeting" as connecting the old with the new - giving space to meet someone new, then checking things to reclaim as shared history - applying also to understanding those within yourself.

### Sign and Perception
- (Signifiers & Tells, [New] Backstage & Privacy)
- Masked & unmasked interactions (MTO's "backstage")
- Privacy of the front & the contents of the system.
- Signifiers vs Tells (brief) & when clocking fronts is okay
- Fronts-between-fronts, blurs, and amalgams

### Chatter and Relation
- (Bonds, Challenges In Communication)
- Diversity in intrasystem communication
- Mediation and backchatter - withheld opinions
- Internal conception of the system as a group, headmate relations

### Sense and Imagination
- (Sensation and Mismatch, [New] Rewiring & Recognition, [New] Intent Backfeed & The Line-In)
- The outputs - phantom limb, AIWS, natural rhythm, gaze, stimulation levels.
- The inputs - intent, determination, emotion, focus, sensation - risk factors.
- Rewiring to perceive the effects of outputs on how someone acts - acknowledgement
- Laying groundwork to mediate over or cooperate with the inputs - interaction.
