    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="plurality">Plurality</h2>
<p><a href="https://morethanone.info/">More Than One</a> defines plurality (or multiplicity) as “The existence of multiple self-aware entities inside one physical brain,” and goes on to explain for the unfamiliar that one could think of a plural collective as “a group of lifelong roommates, but with a body instead of an apartment.” It also defines a <em>Singlet</em> as being “Someone who is not plural. One being in one brain.”</p>
<h4 id="gatekeeping-and-inclusivity">Gatekeeping and Inclusivity</h4>
<p>While this definition is quite effective at conveying the concept of plurality to singlets and those otherwise unfamiliar, it’s sorely lacking for those who find themselves key questions about whether they “qualify” as plural. In which case, a more robust definition is required.</p>
<p>Plurality is in reality an umbrella term that encompasses a diverse set of people, collectives (systems), configurations, and experiences. With this in mind, it can be useful to define plurality as <strong>any experience that is not encompassed by Singlethood</strong> - Where various definitions of “Singlethood” can be explored to prevent gatekeeping and imposter syndrome. </p>
<p>One such definition of singlethood is “The experience of one, continuous, indivisible individual existing alone within one body.” - Those who are more than one, those who are not alone, or those who could introspect to understand that they are divisible into self-aware parts or otherwise are not “continuous” or “unbroken” (such as over time) in a way that isn’t easily explained by other phenomena (like Genderfluidity), may choose to describe themselves or their experiences as plural.</p>
<h2 id="helpful-terms">Helpful Terms</h2>
<p>Pluralfolk frequently have their own preferences regarding terminology, however, here are some more common terms which will be used throughout this resource:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System (or collective):</strong> The plural group that resides within a single brain.</li>
<li><strong>Member (or headmate):</strong> An individual present within a system. “Headmate” is also used to refer to another member of the same system e.g. “My headmate appears to be asleep”</li>
<li><strong>Fronting:</strong> When a member controls the system’s shared physical body. Often referred to as a metaphorical (or mental) position or location i.e. “The Front”, like a driver’s seat.</li>
<li><strong><a href="/systemhood-expanded/#headspaces-and-mindscapes">Headspace</a> (or mindscape):</strong> An internal space or landscape shared by some collectives. May also contain the front, but more frequently is where those who aren’t fronting reside.</li>
<li><strong>Singlet</strong>: Someone who is not plural. See above.</li>
<li><strong>Switching:</strong> When collective members exchange control over the front. “Switch in [to the front]” and “Switch out [of the front]” is often used</li>
<li><strong><a href="/systemhood-expanded/#repression">Repression</a>:</strong> A common term for the period before of a system (or member) becomes self-aware i.e. “Back when I was repressed.” - Doesn’t apply to all systems.</li>
<li><strong><a href="/systemhood-expanded/#medianity-and-the-plural-umbrella">Medianity</a>/Median Systems:</strong> a kind of plural experience where a complete individual is composed of several self-aware “parts” working in tandem. Fits under the plural umbrella.</li>
</ul>
