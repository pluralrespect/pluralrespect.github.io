<h1 id="plural-respect-document">Plural Respect Document</h1>
<p><strong>This document is not intended to introduce the concept of plurality. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Please read <a href="https://morethanone.info/">More Than One</a> first.</strong></p>
<p><em><a href="https://bit.ly/pluralrespect">bit.ly/pluralrespect</a> </em>(Shortened Link)</p>
<p><strong>EN</strong>: Doc is strongly opinionated, but useful nonetheless..</p>
<p><strong>Public version note</strong>: This document was made for a <strong>queer plurals union group</strong> - some artifacts from this are left in for potential usefulness.</p>
<h2 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h2>
<p>[We exist] to serve as a base from which avenues of support and empowerment for plural systems can be established. We acknowledge that community groups for openly plural systems in the same ilk as those for various queer and neurodiverse identities are still in their effective infancy, and that there are many mistakes still to be made - We can only hope to make those mistakes and fix them loudly enough for those who need to hear it. We strive for inclusion, for understanding, and to develop and proudly display the framework of plural understanding required to undermine the rationale behind widespread gatekeeping, apprehension, and hate. </p>
<h2 id="plurality">Plurality</h2>
<p><a href="https://morethanone.info/">More Than One</a> defines plurality (or multiplicity) as “The existence of multiple self-aware entities inside one physical brain,” and goes on to explain for the unfamiliar that one could think of a plural collective as “a group of lifelong roommates, but with a body instead of an apartment.” It also defines a <em>Singlet</em> as being “Someone who is not plural. One being in one brain.”</p>
<h4 id="gatekeeping-insecurity-and-singlethood">Gatekeeping, Insecurity, and Singlethood</h4>
<p>[We acknowledge] that while this definition is quite effective at conveying the concept of plurality to singlets and those otherwise unfamiliar, it’s sorely lacking for those who find themselves key questions about whether they “qualify” as plural. In which case, a more robust definition is required.</p>
<p>Plurality is in reality an umbrella term that encompasses a diverse set of people, collectives (systems), configurations, and experiences. With this in mind, it can be useful to define plurality as <strong>any experience that is not encompassed by Singlethood</strong> - Where various useful definitions of “Singlethood” can be explored to assist in avoiding gatekeeping and imposter syndrome. </p>
<p>One such definition of singlethood is “The experience of one, continuous, indivisible individual existing alone within one body.” Those who are more than one, those who are not alone, or those who could introspect to understand that they are divisible into self-aware parts or otherwise are not “continuous” or “unbroken” (such as over time) in a way that isn’t easily explained by other phenomena (like Genderfluidity), may choose to describe themselves or their experiences as plural.</p>
<h1 id="helpful-terms">Helpful Terms</h1>
<p>Pluralfolk frequently have their own preferences in regards to specific terminology, however, here are some more common terms which will be used throughout this document</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System (or collective):</strong> The plural group that resides within a single brain.</li>
<li><strong>Member</strong> <strong>(or headmate): </strong>An individual present within a system. “Headmate” is also used to refer to another member of the same system e.g. “My headmate appears to be asleep”</li>
<li><strong>Fronting:</strong> When a member controls the system’s shared physical body. Often referred to as a metaphorical (or mental) position or location i.e. “The Front”, like a driver’s seat.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#heading=h.cv18mgaxmxh">Headspace</a> (or mindscape):</strong> An internal space or landscape shared by some collectives. May also contain the front, but more frequently is where those who aren’t fronting reside.</li>
<li><strong>Singlet</strong>: Someone who is not plural. See above.</li>
<li><strong>Switching:</strong> When collective members exchange control over the front. “Switch in [to the front]” and “Switch out [of the front]” is often used</li>
<li><strong><a href="#heading=h.hulnm6bl3mpe">Repression</a>:</strong> A common term for the period before of a system (or member) becomes self-aware i.e. “Back when I was repressed.” - Doesn’t apply to all systems.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#heading=h.8r8w8aa4t9ww">Medianity</a></strong>/Median Systems: a kind of plural experience where a complete individual is composed of several self-aware “parts” working in tandem. Fits under the plural umbrella.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="names-and-pronouns-names-and-pronouns">Names and Pronouns {#names-and-pronouns}</h4>
<p>Members of a system frequently have an individual name (or names), and they should be referred to using this unless otherwise indicated. Systems might also agree on a name to use to refer to the whole system (or the body) which is often called a “System Name” - This can come in the form of a mononym, a first and last name, or frequently in the form of “The [name] System”.</p>
<p>Systems may also have preferences about how to refer to them (purely as members, purely as the system, or a mix) as well as particular first and second person pronouns to use. A fairly standard case would be a system using identical pronouns to a houseful of singlets - “I” for a member, “We” for the system, “You” for a member, “You / You all / Y’all” for the system. </p>
<p>Many other configurations are possible, including “Semiplural” pronouns such as Wei/Muis for first person and You&amp;/Your&amp; (or “You/”, “Your/”) for second person.</p>

<h2 id="gender-gender">Gender {#gender}</h2>
<p><a href="#heading=h.3i684gowcim5">ᐊ BACK</a></p>
<h4 id="inclusion-inclusion">Inclusion {#inclusion}</h4>
<p>It’s important that the gender and transness of the members of a system be respected overall, especially when including them in spaces and conversations for specific groups.</p>
<h4 id="pronouns-and-gender-pronouns-and-gender">Pronouns and Gender {#pronouns-and-gender}</h4>
<p>Members of a system often have differing pronouns, including he/she/they/it, various neopronouns, and various second person pronouns (such as second person it/its). These should be respected and used, adapting to request.</p>
<p>Frequently, this is because the members of a system have different genders, and will then also have different gendered words they’re comfortable and uncomfortable with. This should be respected. As a note, some members and systems may consider their pronouns to be an extension of their name, rather than related to gender at all.</p>
<h4 id="transness-transness">Transness {#transness}</h4>
<p>With high levels of intersectionality between trans folk and plural systems, it’s important to outline how a plural system or its members might view or relate to transness. For some systems, being trans is simply the state of the physical body and the system overall, and all members are neither trans nor cis (as they have no AGAB). Some are similar, but consider all members cis, or all members trans - sometimes regardless of how each individual member aligns with the AGAB of the system. For other systems, transness exists on an individual level, with each member considering themselves trans or cis based on their lived experience and gut feeling. </p>

<p><a href="#heading=h.3i684gowcim5">ᐊ BACK</a></p>
<h4 id="inclusion-inclusion_1">Inclusion {#inclusion}</h4>
<p>Members of a system often have differing sexuality and preferences, and should be included in the spaces with which they identify. If a system feels that they are incapable of excluding one of their members from a space in which they don’t belong, a discussion should be had with that space to determine how to proceed.</p>
<h4 id="consent-consent">Consent {#consent}</h4>
<p>How a particular system accounts for consent is related to how they cooperate and communicate. For this reason, it’s important to understand that especially when a matter relates to a system’s body, the consent of the fronting member is not necessarily enough. A system needs to have functional cooperation to guarantee consent - with this knowledge, a fronting member may give their word that the consent is universal, or members may be asked one at a time to be thorough.</p>

<h2 id="appearance-and-humanity-appearance-and-humanity">Appearance and Humanity {#appearance-and-humanity}</h2>
<p><a href="#heading=h.3i684gowcim5">ᐊ BACK</a></p>
<h4 id="self-image-self-image">Self-Image {#self-image}</h4>
<p>Members of a system frequently have an appearance (or “Self-Image”) that differs from the physical appearance of the body. Some singlets experience this as well, but it’s exceedingly common amongst pluralfolk - this is because if many members of a system were to identify with the same body, they couldn’t do so uniquely. Some members might have only a slightly different appearance to the body (or think of themselves as always wearing different clothes), others might have a self-image of an entirely different person, and others still might have a self image that isn’t human at all.</p>
<h4 id="nonhumanity-nonhumanity">Nonhumanity {#nonhumanity}</h4>
<p>Many pluralfolk don’t see themselves as human - instead they might see themselves as other living creatures (real, mythical, fictional, or something only they can describe) - as more abstract entities (e.g. a shadow) or concepts (e.g. “Fire”) - varying wildly based on the system configuration. Nonhumanity is a much larger concept that occurs in singlets, but again is quite frequent among plural systems. There are many nonhuman subcultures that partially define this experience (though riddled with <em>causal prescriptivism</em>) - one notable example being the Voidpunk community, whose plural members might believe their nonhumanity to be a result of society’s concept of “human” being innately singular.</p>
<h4 id="shortcuts-shortcuts">Shortcuts {#shortcuts}</h4>
<p>Frequently, pluralfolk will use words to describe their appearance that don’t literally describe themselves, but are instead a “shortcut” to give a general idea of what they look like. The vast majority of nonhuman pluralfolk are (self admittedly) of effectively their own species or type, not an existing one - so pre-existing concepts are applied to speed up the explanation process.  Sometimes that means using “cat” to mean “taking on some physical features of a cat”, or using “minotaur” to mean “appearing similarly to the form of the mythical minotaur”, but at other times it can mean supplying references (photos of celebrities and fictional characters, passages from fiction, etc) to give a rough idea to others.</p>

<h2 id="headmates-headmates">Headmates {#headmates}</h2>
<p><a href="#heading=h.3i684gowcim5">ᐊ BACK</a></p>
<h4 id="communication-communication">Communication {#communication}</h4>
<p>System members communicate with others outside their system in various means, some are verbal while fronting and have either similar or different voices to other members, some aren’t verbal but can form (and type/write/sign) full sentences, some can’t themselves type/write/sign full sentences but can have other members help them do so, and others can’t form sentences at all and communicate through feelings and ideas (that other members may be able to explain or translate).</p>
<p>Headmates often have to manually converse with one another, as they don’t necessarily share understanding or memory. Some systems can do this without any external input - simply speaking inside themselves, sometimes at higher speeds than verbal conversation. Many others need to speak aloud or use external tools like a notepad, a voice recorder, a private chat server, or even a conversation with a friend to mediate, in order to communicate with one another. </p>
<p>Don’t expect one member to remember or understand something you’ve taught to another by default, nor to agree to something another agreed to.</p>
<h4 id="cooperation-conflict-and-competence-cooperation-conflict-and-competence">Cooperation, Conflict, and Competence {#cooperation-conflict-and-competence}</h4>
<p>To operate effectively, systems often need to first learn to communicate, then to cooperate. While cases vary wildly, systems that are able to at least begrudgingly get along tend to have a more positive experience with the everyday - handling daily tasks, swapping the front, communicating with others, and so on. </p>
<p>Often moving towards headmate cooperation involves self-acceptance, and acceptance of others. Many system members are uncomfortable with or reject the idea of being a member of the system they’re in (or the body that entails) - or reject the presence of others around them. The first step of cooperating is accepting that the reality of the situation is that all system members are, in fact, system members - whether they get along or not.</p>
<p>Conflict can easily arise within a system from things like differing comfort levels with the body, different tastes on clothing or appearance, or plural-specific issues like someone not being allowed much time in the front. Some conflicts can be resolved internally but many systems require an external mediator to try and talk through the issue with both parties.</p>
<p>A few boons of a cooperative system include each member being able to have the kind of time in front they prefer, being able to help themselves and the other members of the system by playing to their own strengths while swapping out for things they have the most trouble with, and being able to better work with the system’s memory by keeping eachother in the loop.</p>
<p>Every system rests at a different level of cooperation, and some can’t breach certain barriers like communication, or willingly swapping the front. This should be respected, and not pushed uninvited.</p>
<h4 id="bonds-bonds">Bonds {#bonds}</h4>
<p>From the point of communication, or sometimes even a lack thereof, bonds between headmates can be quite diverse - which is a frequent point of insecurity for many systems. Many pluralfolk consider their headmates to be close friends, housemates they simply put up with, or a small family of some kind. Others still, frequently nonmonogamous alloromantic pluralfolk, might consider the friendliness and closeness (literally “zero distance”) of their headmate and themselves to be innately romantic - though what that entails varies wildly, including sometimes nothing at all. </p>
<p>Beyond specific labels, system members might have more fine-grained ways to relate to eachother - mentorships, rivalries, or just simply wanting to keep headmates safe and/or happy - for their own benefit or otherwise. A common cornerstone of shame for many pluralfolk and systems, though one that <em>is</em> able to be overcome in many cases, is that some headmates, due to the nature of existing in the same body with a functional libido (or for other reasons), consider the nature of their friendship or relationship to be inherently sexual, and what this entails again varies wildly. </p>
<p>Many bonds between headmates rely heavily on being able to socialise and interact in group environments - with people outside of their own systems involved. This gives some pluralfolk the opportunity to keep a conversation flowing without getting stuck or feeling insecure (i.e <em>Internalised Saneism</em>). Building rapport with others outside a system, especially over multiple members, can be very helpful for systems learning to work together - even without direct support.</p>

<h2 id="physicality-physicality">Physicality {#physicality}</h2>
<p><a href="#heading=h.3i684gowcim5">ᐊ BACK</a></p>
<h4 id="the-body-the-body">The Body {#the-body}</h4>
<p>Members of a plural system share their body (usually “The Body”, “The System’s body” or sometimes “Vessel”). This creates awkward practicalities in daily life. The clothes one member puts on in the morning is not necessarily the clothes the fronting member wants to be in in the afternoon. Physical transition plans may clash, voices may feel incorrect, and so on. </p>
<p>\
While some systems consider the body to be owned by a “<a href="#potentially-unhelpful-terms">Host</a>” of some kind, most pluralfolk understand that they have a responsibility to treat the body as shared (though this may take time to accept).</p>
<h4 id="sensation-and-mismatch">Sensation and Mismatch</h4>
<p>Some elements of plurality exist beyond thoughts and headspace, but stretch into sensation (which could be considered more “subconscious” by comparison) - as an example, many pluralfolk experience a physical-feeling sensation when switching in or out of the front (often a “floating”, “sliding”, or “shifting” feeling), or feeling a presence (like a “shadow on the shoulder”) of a headmate being close by. </p>
<p>Where system members have differing appearances, this can impact how they experience being fronting. As an example, members who are taller may feel like the ground is further below them when they front, or that others around them “feel” less tall. Members who have a dissimilar frame to the body (or even aren’t bipedal) might feel clumsy while fronting, and have trouble with basic movement and manipulation. Members with additional appendages (legs, arms, horns, ears, tails, etc) might feel like those features are “ghostily” attached to their body, in varying levels of sensation.</p>
<h4 id="signifiers-and-tells-signifiers-and-tells">Signifiers and “Tells” {#signifiers-and-“tells”}</h4>
<p>Members of a system can _Signify _that they're fronting to others in various ways - Swappable name tags, reintroducing themselves when a switch occurs, or online using text signifiers (such as starting messages with a letter or emoji) or accessibility tools (e.g. PluralKit for discord) to indicate who is speaking. </p>
<p>Members can sometimes be told apart without signifiers (to varying degrees of accuracy) either consciously or subconsciously. On the conscious level, fronting members often exhibit different speech patterns and voices, and over time one could notice differences in gestures and other bodily expressions. Subconsciously, footfalls and the way a member walks can become recognisable. Finally, the way a certain body and face is held (often called it's "Tensions" - posture, resting face, etc) can eventually form a second-nature guess for who's fronting in a system - to the point where someone might feel that photos of two different fronters taken seconds apart have "different faces." </p>

<h4 id="potentially-unhelpful-terms-potentially-unhelpful-terms">Potentially Unhelpful Terms {#potentially-unhelpful-terms}</h4>
<p>Some terms, while still in active use, have been identified as having the potential to cause harm to others - especially when used to refer to systems generally or without asking a system's preferences. Careful consideration should be made before using these. </p>
<p>A list of these terms along with reasons they may be considered harmful (and in what contexts) is supplied below</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Host / Primary</strong> <strong>headmat</strong>e<ul>
<li>Used to refer to a headmate as being the most notable, complex, or present compared to other members.</li>
<li>Devalues other members of the system as being “secondary”, “accessories” or in extreme cases “property” to the primary headmate.</li>
<li>“Host” is also used to refer to a headmate that performs some kind of central function of the system, which is not harmful in the same way. Hosts might be the member that fronts when the body wakes up, that helps others speak and move the body, or simply that finds it the easiest to front.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>(The) Original</strong><ul>
<li>Used to refer to a member of a system who is seen as existing before the self-discovery of the system.</li>
<li><a href="#causal-prescriptivism-and-faith">Causal Prescriptivism</a>. Many systems simply don’t have an “Original” headmate, and find the concept uncomfortable.</li>
<li>Should be avoided even where it applies in favour of more explicit phrasing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Personalities</strong><ul>
<li>Used to describe the nature of a system (or all systems).</li>
<li><a href="#causal-prescriptivism-and-faith">Causal Prescriptivism</a>. Also, describing system members as “personalities” is reductive. Might imply relation to MPD (see below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>“People with MPD/DID/OSDD” (in place of “Plural”)</strong><ul>
<li>Used to describe the nature of a system (or all systems).</li>
<li><a href="#system-bucketing">System Bucketing</a>. Also sysmedicalism - implies that systems must receive a specific diagnosis in order to be plural.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Alter</strong><ul>
<li>Used in place of “headmate”, specifically to refer to those other than the “host”/”original”.</li>
<li>Implies headmates other than the host can only exist as “alternate versions”.</li>
<li>Remains appropriate for specific systems (at their request) - not appropriate to prescribe onto others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Traumagenic/Endogenic</strong><ul>
<li>Used to describe a system’s (psychological) causality as being based in trauma or not.</li>
<li><a href="#causal-prescriptivism-and-faith">Causal Prescriptivism</a> and <a href="#system-bucketing">System Bucketing</a>. This supposed binary doesn’t exist without discarding all non-psychological casualties (or distaste for causalities altogether) a system might have. </li>
<li>Even when used to describe a specific system, best practice is to talk more explicitly about a system’s beliefs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Persecutor/Protector/Etc (Headmate Archetype Labels)</strong><ul>
<li>Used to describe a specific system member as being of a certain archetype or nature, with a particular function.</li>
<li><a href="#system-bucketing">System Bucketing (#3 - Member Archetypes)</a>. Harmful in that it devalues the individual and pushes them away from further self exploration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>“More Plural” or “Less Plural”</strong><ul>
<li>Used to talk about togetherness/separateness of individuals and systems, as well as when talking about <a href="#medianity-and-the-plural-umbrella">median systems</a>.</li>
<li>Plurality is an umbrella, and a community - all pluralfolk are the same amount of plural - though some do have plural experience more or less often. Medianity and median systems (as an example) are not “less plural” for being more intertwined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>“That Person is Plural” or “That Person <em>has</em> a plural system / <em>has</em> plurality”</strong><ul>
<li>Used when referring to a specific member (or more practically, a host or previously-presumed-singlet).</li>
<li>Systems are plural, and members and systems alike are often referred to as pluralfolk. Referring to a person as “having” plurality trivialises their existence and has heavy sysmedicalist connotations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>“You four (bodies)” or “There are six people (bodies) here”</strong><ul>
<li>Used when referring to a group of people, specifically counting by body (regardless of whether all involved are singlets)</li>
<li>Applying a body-based counting system to a plural system can be insensitive. Few systems consider themselves countable as “one person” - even when only one member fronts at a time. </li>
<li>Avoid the phrasing unless you know better. In cases where it’s necessary, work around the issue by saying things like “five systems/singlets” or “five user accounts”. Using “you four” to refer to a system of four can still be very appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"New" System / Newly Plural / Etc<ul>
<li>Used to describe systems that have recently discovered themselves, or recently come out to the speaker</li>
<li>Most systems simply aren't new, and those just learning the words to describe their experiences now, or allowing themselves to feel repressed things, are not "new" to plurality. </li>
<li>Better terminology includes "inexperienced system", or with specific regards to time, "green system" (popularised in MMO games for new players) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-silence-of-singlet-normativity-the-silence-of-singlet-normativity">The Silence of Singlet-Normativity {#the-silence-of-singlet-normativity}</h4>
<p>From the point of self awareness, wider society instils that singlethood is the sole truth of every individual's existence. Much of the apprehension over plurality exists simply because most people aren't exposed to the concept at all. As a result, repressed systems frequently feel a fear that they will become "too complicated" to be accepted or liked by their friends. Just like for other forms of neurodiversity, instilling neurotypicality in this way oversimplifies people's lives and experiences and ignores any outliers. Neurotypical-normativity trades acceptance and care for slight convenience - often without realising it has done so.</p>
<h4 id="difficulty-of-discovery-and-adjacent-subcultures">Difficulty of discovery (and adjacent subcultures)</h4>
<p>Because of Singlet-Normativity, most presumed-singlets don't have the exposure required to question their singlethood for quite some time. Beyond this, most people's first exposure to plurality is through lenses dissimilar to the one presented here - sysmedicalism, psychological horror, poor fantasy-plural media representation, and so on - often, these lenses are far more narrow, involve causal prescriptivism, or cast aside the concept as fantasy entirely. </p>
<p>In addition, many questioning pluralfolk (and singlets alike) have had encounters with cultures and communities that interact directly or indirectly with plural experience, without defining it as completely as plural communities are able to. One example is the <em>Tulpamancy</em> community, which is based around the practice of "creating" a system member (usually a <a href="#fuzztives-and-ocs">Fictive</a>) through great effort - often without any consideration towards the ethics of doing so, or of treating any living entity as a "creation". Often the possibility of doing so isn't considered either for that matter - It's not uncommon for those involved to attempt the process only to instead uncover a repressed headmate (sometimes without realising they have done so - leading to unhealthy dynamics). </p>
<h4 id="representation-in-media-representation-in-media">Representation in Media {#representation-in-media}</h4>
<p>Plural representation in media is often poor, in various different ways. Very few instances of plural representation are explicitly plural, and many could be considered "fantasy-plural" - invoking some sort of supernatural or technological causality for a plural system's existence (relocated souls, recovered AI, etc). Common harmful or stereotypical depictions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Jekyll and Hyde: i.e one "normal person" (expect white men) and one evil murderer with little regard for others. </li>
<li>The Yin and Yang: two system members that are "opposites" (common in media where the system must integrate to be "cured") </li>
<li>The Straight-Talker and the Funny-guy: Mostly harmless <em>when</em> not treated like an illness to be pitied or cured. Two system members include one self-serious, often stuffy member, and one who's always cracking jokes. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="victims-of-the-slippery-slope-victims-of-the-slippery-slope">Victims of the Slippery Slope {#victims-of-the-slippery-slope}</h4>
<p>Some homophobic and transphobic rhetoric, especially political messaging, utilises the sysphobia of the larger population in order to further their arguments (e.g. "I don't accept my child talking about their imaginary friend, so why would I accept my child telling me their gender"). Fearmongering political messaging and even horror films play into the idea that a plural system is innately scary or disconcerting. Many plural systems live fulfilling lives both in and out of the closet, and the lack of exposure to this through media representation and education allows this harmful practice to occur.</p>
<h4 id="objectification-and-privacy-objectification-and-privacy">Objectification and Privacy  {#objectification-and-privacy}</h4>
<p>Plural systems are frequently populated by members with complex individuality  - life experiences, feelings, friends, memory. However, misplaced feelings in seemingly supportive onlookers can lead to devaluing these individuals by treating them like shiny new costumes for the singlet they were presumed to be - assuming they already know each headmate before meeting them, voicing positive feelings about them, and so on. Plural systems do not exist for the entertainment of others, and should never be treated as such. </p>
<p>Similarly, one shouldn't assume that familiarity with a system during repression is an invitation to ask about a system, its configuration and contents, bonds between headmates, or conflicts and struggles. Every system has a right to privacy. </p>
<h4 id="the-neurodiversity-of-plurality-and-why-support-is-critical">The Neurodiversity of Plurality and Why Support is Critical</h4>
<p>Plural systems that are directly confronted by sysphobia are primarily attacked through rhetoric that dismisses the existence of plurality altogether as a premise. Frequently, sysphobia uses this premise to imply that a system that believes in their own existence must be incapable of rational thought, or knowingly fabricating their experience to some end (attention, distraction from personal issues, etc). Singlet allyship is particularly effective against these kinds of sysphobia, as showing that many kinds of people are capable of understanding and respecting plural systems undercuts the argument. Beyond this unwanted influence, systems often feel that accepting singlets around them mitigate feelings of imposter syndrome, at least in part. </p>
<p>Plural experience is a diverse thing, and it's worth noting that like other kinds of neurodiverse communities and support, plural support can be effectively applied to help singlets with overlapping difficulties or issues - just like how neurotypical-adjacent people can be taught to stim through extreme stress, singlets can be shown how to better handle dissociation, separate self image, and so on. The umbrella of plural experience is wide, and the skillset most plural systems need to develop for their every day can easily help singlets and those experiencing brief plurality. </p>
<h2 id="sysmedicalism-sysmedicalism">Sysmedicalism {#sysmedicalism}</h2>
<p><a href="#heading=h.3i684gowcim5">ᐊ BACK</a></p>
<h4 id="diagnosis-what-why-impacts-therapy-diagnosis-what-why-impacts-therapy">Diagnosis - What, Why, Impacts, Therapy {#diagnosis-what-why-impacts-therapy}</h4>
<p>Many medical diagnoses are associated with plurality, but all of them suffer from the impacts of singlet-normativity. DID, as an example, is a diagnosis that is based around symptoms like distress, large gaps in memory, losing control of the body, unknown voices, and difficulty knowing the self, which - as might be clear from the rest of this document - are difficulties that many systems that are yet to establish proper communication and cooperation are extremely likely to experience, but all of which can often be completely resolved by working to improve this. One can conclude from this that it might be inaccurate to describe DID as a diagnosis <em>for</em> plurality, but rather a diagnosis of particular kinds of distress and difficulty that are common to plural systems.  However, this is not how a DID diagnosis is treated in reality; frequently, despite these distressing systems being required for diagnosis, a patient is considered to have DID for as long as they remain plural - regardless of whether the distress is completely resolved - and are simply “managing” their symptoms. To put it curtly, the conflation of the two by professionals, researchers, and others, is a bit like calling all instances of transness cases of “Acute Gender Dysphoria”.</p>
<p>There are many reasons a plural system might seek a diagnosis relating to their plurality, however the largest reasons tend to be either the diagnosis being the in-road to understanding that they aren’t a singlet at all (lack of knowledge), or seeking financial support due to difficulties living as a plural system. Systems that have received a related medical diagnosis are no less or more plural than any other system, and it should be acknowledged that many systems with adjacent diagnoses today are affected by gatekeeping when attempting to receive medical treatment for things like trans and chronic pain issues.</p>
<p>Beyond medical diagnoses, some therapists are specialised in handling issues within plural systems from different angles, with varying amounts of flaws. The most common of which is usually referred to as <em>Family Group Therapy</em> which, while generally equipped to help systems communicate and cooperate, frequently treat systems and their members as means to an end. This often leads to harmful causal prescriptivism in terms of the automatic assumption that system members are “created” by the brain in response to external stimuli (and that this can and should be done on request) which can be extremely harmful to self-worth.</p>
<h4 id="system-bucketing-system-bucketing">System Bucketing {#system-bucketing}</h4>
<p>Another widespread sysmed issue is bucketing systems based on a diagnosis, or creating categories based on specific diagnoses - using words like “DID Systems” or “Trauma Systems”, and “Traumagenic/Endogenic”. These often come with groupings of plural experience, such as ownership and separation of a system’s memory, how independently a system’s members operate, and so on. This is wildly inappropriate as neither causality nor diagnosis are indicative of a plural system’s experiences, and these assumptions lead to widespread gatekeeping. Every system is unique, and pushing a system towards a specific expectation, simplification, or “archetype” can cause serious harm.</p>
<p>Some of the most important sysphobia to avoid as singlet ally or an existing system is making assumptions about the nature of other systems - especially systems that are only beginning to understand themselves, or are unsure whether they are systems at all. Assumptions like conflicting thoughts or presences “certainly” being other system members, assuming that all dissociation is sourced from plurality, that systems are of a certain configuration, or that a system member is of a specific “archetype” - can all be very harmful to a system’s wellbeing. </p>
<p>To focus in on the final point, there exists a widespread (harmful) belief that system members can fall into specific “types” or “natures”, that almost completely define them - members may be described as “evil” or a “prosecutor” or “protector” and so on. Practically, many system members do have specific competencies that allow them to help their headmates in specific specialised ways - they might feel that they have a <em>role</em> in a system that they’re particularly good at, but still exist as unique individual entities, and can choose to do what they want.</p>
<h4 id="causal-prescriptivism-and-faith-causal-prescriptivism-and-faith">Causal Prescriptivism (and faith) {#causal-prescriptivism-and-faith}</h4>
<p>To practice Causal Prescriptivism is to tell other systems why they are systems, or members why they exist, or are a certain way. Some people don’t immediately understand this as harmful (as a result of objectification of plurality), despite already understanding the significant harm caused by singlets being told why they exist (in prescriptive faith or lack thereof). </p>
<p>Every system has different feelings about causality - some feel that they came into existence at a certain point in time, some feel that they’ve been around for as long as the body has, and some simply don’t know - more still among these insist that the concept of causality itself is unwelcome discussion and that they would prefer to focus on making good on their own existence (much like many singlets). </p>
<p>Some systems have specific faith and belief relating to their causality, such as system members appearing within the system through divine intervention, or through universal processes completely outside of their control. As with all faith, don’t pry and don’t prescribe - but be open to others beliefs of themselves.</p>

<h4 id="appearance-and-nonhuman-shortcuts-appearance-and-nonhuman-shortcuts">Appearance and Nonhuman Shortcuts {#appearance-and-nonhuman-shortcuts}</h4>
<p>Existing myths and fictional characters are often used as quick descriptive shortcuts for members to explain their own appearance - especially for nonhuman system members. Simplified sentences are often thrown around that don’t make this explicit, such as “I’m some kind of centaur”, and while this can be okay casually it’s important to remember that these are usually shortcuts, and being explicit can proactively avoid some conflict over appropriation of myth (or intellectual property).</p>
<h4 id="fuzztives-and-ocs-fuzztives-and-ocs">Fuzztives and OCs {#fuzztives-and-ocs}</h4>
<p>Some system members relate heavily to not just a mythical or fictional creature or species but rather a specific existing character. These members are often (inappropriately archetypally, often harmfully) referred to as “fictives” or “fuzztives”, with the latter offering more acknowledgement of the member as an individual that <em>sees</em> themself in a fictional character, and in fact is capable of making their own self discoveries and expressions as a unique person, rather than (causal-prescriptively) often considering a system member to be a 1:1 “rip-off” of an existing character that was “fabricated” in response to them. </p>
<p>More generally speaking, fuzztive-esque system members might have a similar appearance to a character, a similar or adopted name, and similar attitudes or speaking patterns - however, it’s important to remember that this phenomena is also common in singlets, where both particularly relatable characters might have similar attitudes, speech patterns, or clothing styles - and even may have their names or style adopted by someone (especially trans folk) who realise that they’re able to express in those ways and be seen positively. Fuzztive-esque system members might diverge from fiction over time, sometimes even in just days, when they are given the opportunity for self exploration.</p>
<p>Another common intersection of fiction and plurality is Original Characters (OCs) - various creative types (writers, artists, tabletop roleplayers) might create original characters for their stories, art, or roleplaying (including sometimes video game RPG characters), that they later unearth some kind of fuzztive-esque system member relating to. Sometimes this occurs the same way that existing characters often do, where a character is reflected on and found to be relatable and expressive - however it can also be found that a system member, while repressed, either directly created or assisted in the creation of the character to express themselves.</p>
<p>System members that are fuzztive-esque should ensure they acknowledge the potential for harm caused by claiming certain existing properties for themselves, but should be respected like all other pluralfolk.</p>

<h4 id="medianity-and-the-plural-umbrella-medianity-and-the-plural-umbrella">Medianity and the Plural Umbrella {#medianity-and-the-plural-umbrella}</h4>
<p><em>“Plural collectives vary greatly in how separate their members are. A collective might see themselves as one being made of many facets, or many people coinhabiting one head, or even somewhere in-between.” - More Than One</em></p>
<p>Not all systems are composed of a body and several individuals - sometimes, a single individual is divisible into several self-aware entities, aspects, or parts, that work together to form a singular identity - this is often referred to as a “Median System”. Sometimes a median system exists within a body, other times, a median system is a system member - with other non-divisible members existing around them. Median systems often don't have a “front”, and frequently share resources (thoughts and memory etc) much more closely. Median systems almost always have a name, and while the entities that compose them may be able to speak or act on their own, this isn’t as common as in other plural systems. </p>
<p>Medianity is only a secondary typical case to “Body and several individuals” - plurality is a wide umbrella that encompasses many experiences. It’s important to be open to diversity and adapt to what others need, even if it doesn’t reflect the system configurations that you know already.</p>
<h4 id="faith-and-xenomemory-faith-and-xenomemory">Faith and Xenomemory {#faith-and-xenomemory}</h4>
<p>To go along with system members with faith-based casualties that feel they were sent to or appeared in a system from another place, and fuzztive-esque system members who relate with a character on an identity level, some system members have what are usually called “Xenomemories” - feelings that they partially remember things that occurred to them before appearing within the system. Often this simply occurs when the given system member dreams - whether it’s the events of a past life or similar, or the events previously absorbed in fiction. These members have to take responsibility and understanding of these past xenomemories (regardless of acceptance or rejection) to be able to properly manage how they might affect how they feel in their present.</p>
<h4 id="headspaces-and-mindscapes-headspaces-and-mindscapes">Headspaces and Mindscapes {#headspaces-and-mindscapes}</h4>
<p>Many systems have internal spaces that they share between members. These may follow the overall structure of an apartment - with “rooms” for each member and a space connecting each. Often, rooms are either manually decorated with or vaguely reflect the styles and interests of those who reside there. </p>
<p>These spaces can also be metaphorical representations for the mind and its functions overall - for example, containing a literal library that houses memory, or a bridge or control station of “the front”. </p>
<p>Despite usually following the same overall structure, the actual landscape of a headspace can vary wildly - houses, spaceships, regular ships, caves, forests, and so on. In addition, mindscapes are not always “visualised” (with imagined vision) - they are often navigated through other pseudo-senses such as sounds, touch, smells, or even a kind of spatial sense.</p>
<h4 id="countability-temporality-and-inner-worlds-countability-temporality-and-inner-worlds">Countability, Temporality, and Inner Worlds {#countability-temporality-and-inner-worlds}</h4>
<p>Some systems don’t contain an easily countable number of members. Certain kinds of median systems may have an “in between” number of members, or feel like new members are constantly shuffled in and old members are recycled into new ones (in what could be called a “Temporal” median system). Some may instead have a count of theoretical members far beyond what could be realistically listed, with those who front stepping forth from an incredibly large mindscape (or “inner world”) to be one of the few who are able to represent the others. Some system configurations seem daunting, but in similar ways to explaining gender, there’s always a level of explanatory depth that even an unfamiliar party can understand and respect.</p>

<h4 id="repression-repression">Repression {#repression}</h4>
<p>The period before a system or system member is made self aware is often referred to as when they were “repressed”, or simply “repression”. Sometimes, this means that the system member appeared to be not present at all and had no influence on the system, but often a repressed system member does influence the system (or supposed singlet) - either by being muddled and falsely intertwined with another member (or many), or by making subconscious impacts to the way a system feels, often in line with their feelings of being unable to express themselves, or insecurities / other issues that may need to be resolved down the line. </p>
<p>Sometimes, a repressed headmate acts almost entirely like a self-aware headmate - fronting, speaking, thinking, and interacting with others - but nobody in the system (often supposed singlet) has the knowledge to understand that they are a headmate, or that such a thing is possible at all. Once the concept is introduced, the process of communicating and cooperating may be very quick.</p>
<h4 id="discovery-and-communication-discovery-and-communication">Discovery and Communication {#discovery-and-communication}</h4>
<p>The process and period of discovery varies from system to system. For some systems, discovery is a dramatic process where a member suddenly fronts or speaks for the first time ever and communication is frantically established (if the support structures are there to do so). For others, it can be a long introspective process where the workings and oddities of the system, or even a specific member (or presumed singlet), are carefully considered for what they might mean (and who they might imply). </p>
<p>Often, discovery starts with a hunch, or suspicion, that some kind of plurality (whether in the long term or a short plural experience) may exist within a presumed singlet - Maybe a presence that feels separate in the distance, or some kind of inconsistency that doesn’t feel like it’s easily explained by other forms of fluidity (gender, mood, etc), and so on. For presumed singlets that don’t experience any kind of switching or internal conversation, they may need to make legitimate attempts to make “first contact” where they might leave notes for potential system members, or be helped to temporarily “loosen their grip” on the front in a safe environment.</p>
<p>Even after learning to switch, many systems still lack effective communication, and need to make use of an external mediator until they can establish a system for note-taking or internal communication. For systems with headspaces, the latter sometimes coincides with learning to navigate them.</p>
<h4 id="stereotypicality-archetypes-and-fight-or-flight-stereotypicality-archetypes-and-fight-or-flight">Stereotypicality, Archetypes, and Fight-Or-Flight {#stereotypicality-archetypes-and-fight-or-flight}</h4>
<p>The process of discovery for a headmate (or whole system) is often messy. A big reason for this is that headmates that have been repressed often need to be given space in order to come to understand themselves and their environment, and before this point can act in very two-dimensional ways, or lash out at others and reject communication (not unlike a wounded animal). </p>
<p>When a member is first made self-aware, it’s common that they might appear “stereotypical” or “two dimensional” - appearing in only very specific situations to do very specific things (e.g. ). This is a common after-effect of repression, and over time the member may have the space to explore themselves in more depth and realise other things about themselves.</p>

<h3 id="fronting-fronting">Fronting {#fronting}</h3>
<p>The front has been already defined as a metaphorical “position” for a system member who is controlling the body/voice of a system. However, there’s more to explain in order to properly understand the front. </p>
<p><em>Co-Fronting</em> is the phenomenon where multiple system members work together to control the body and voice simultaneously. This either means that they either collectively act and move, control different parts of the body, or simply “multitask” and are able to switch control of the body (or a specific part of it) in fractions of a second. This split body or multitasking can potentially allow for completing tasks that would normally be quite difficult - writing with both hands at once, for example - or, more practically, holding a conversation over a text chat while also holding a verbal conversation, with minimal pauses and few opportunities to lose the thread of either.</p>
<p>Co-fronting is usually the word used for confident, skilled simultaneous fronting. However it’s not uncommon for pluralfolk to be unsure about who is fronting, or feel like several headmates are floating “around” the front without any confident front. This experience (often “Marbling”) could be fairly mundane and just another part of a system’s experience, but is frequently a source of distress and insecurity - many preferring to have a clear front or fronts.</p>
<h3 id="switching-switching">Switching {#switching}</h3>
<p>Switching has already been described as moving members from back to front and vice versa. While some systems switch quite often, others switch very infrequently or not at all - with either just one member (e.g. a median system) or with one member remaining at the front, and all other members remaining in the back (the fronter may choose to help them communicate if they want and are able to). </p>
<p>Some systems are able to switch using an internal will - either through a collective will of the system to swap one member for another, or by any headmate forcing their way out of the front (creating a vacuum that switches in an idle headmate), or forcing their way into the front, replacing the current fronter. </p>
<p>For most systems, this is not the primary way in which they switch. Common causes for switching include fronting members getting tired or uncomfortable and drifting backwards, certain stimuli (conversation topics, preferred music, hearing their name, etc) bringing a member to the front, or seemingly at complete random.</p>
<p>For systems without willful control of switching already, they can still make deliberate switches by utilising how their system already operates. Listening to a member’s favourite music, asking for someone else to call their name, or speak about something they are passionate about, changing signifiers (like swapping out a nametag or clothes), or just briefly meditating on the thoughts of a headmate, are all reasonable ways to attempt to invite a switch.</p>
<h3 id="fatigue-fatigue">Fatigue {#fatigue}</h3>
<p>After fronting for long periods, or fronting in attempts to mask the system around others, system members can experience fatigue. This fatigue could be thought of as “fronter’s fatigue”, however it’s quite likely that singlets experience the exact same fatigue in some cases - they just can’t resolve it any other way than resting their whole body. By contrast, system members may be able to swap out of the front in order to catch an equivalent break, allowing for a less fatigued system member to handle things. </p>
<p>Beyond switching out, members may find that they are able to “sleep” while in the back, which is more restful than just not fronting. This usually makes the member unlikely to swap in randomly and slightly harder to call upon - however, this can be beneficial by helping members that front less often be more accessible (by “clearing the way.”)</p>
<h2 id="animals-and-ages-animals-and-ages">Animals and Ages {#animals-and-ages}</h2>
<p><a href="#heading=h.3i684gowcim5">ᐊ BACK</a></p>
<h4 id="inclusion-inclusion_2">Inclusion {#inclusion}</h4>
<p>Some system members may act in similar ways to, think in similar ways to, or be some way in effect, either of a young age or be a sentient (but not sapient) animal. It’s important to have an understanding of the way these members interact in a system, especially in regards to inclusion in spaces. One example is 18+ spaces, where often rules will need to take a minimum between the age of a system and the age of a specific member, and systems may have to disclose whether they’re able to control member interaction closely enough to safely interact in such a space. </p>
<p>The aforementioned animal-esque types - not to be confused with nonhuman members capable of clear thought - are occasionally (harmfully?) referred to as “feral”, and shouldn’t be included in nsfw spaces due to an inability to consent (tldr <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harkness-test">[2]</a>). Many spaces (including plural spaces) aren’t really designed with animal-like system members in mind, but should make some attempt to allow for them to interact with others, while respecting that room consent could apply.</p>

<h4 id="culturalreligious-engagement-inclusion-cultural-religious-engagement-inclusion">Cultural/Religious Engagement / Inclusion {#cultural-religious-engagement-inclusion}</h4>
<p><em>EN: Language here is going to be some form of clumsy, it’ll need edits.</em></p>
<p>Some system members may feel an affinity with or simply interested in engaging in a particular culture. It’s the responsibility of both the member to <em>genuinely</em> make attempts to engage with said culture rather than potentially raising issues with appropriation (as well as to respect the wishes of said culture with regard to whether they may engage with it at all), and for the other members of said culture to make the same reasonable allowances for a member of a system as they might towards any (“outsider”) singlet - other members of a system not engaging with a culture should not be an excuse for exclusion of another (except where this is rigidly unworkable within practice/belief).</p>
